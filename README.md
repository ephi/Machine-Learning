# Machine Learning

Implementation of ML algorithms.  
Ex1: Simple Linear Regression solved with gradient descent and with closed analytical solution  
Ex2: Linear Regression solved with gradient descent and with closed analytical solution(with examples for overfitting)  
Ex3: linear and non-linear classifiers using Logistic Regression  
Ex4: multi-class classification using Logistic Regression and Confusion Matrix  
Ex5: Kernel trick & Linear/Non-Linear SVM using sklearn  
Ex6: K-means unsupervised classification  
Ex7: Gaussian Mixture Models(GMM) 
Ex8: PCA  
Project: implmentation of Gaussian naive-Bayes classifier. using the classifier on face database with K-fold cross-validation and PCA to find optimal learning dimenssion
